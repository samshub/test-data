These initiatives typically complement a corporation’s business engagement with society, communities and consumers through voluntary sharing of resources to support social causes and help meet societal needs that are not fully met via other channels. Such activities are intended to deliver benefit to society and not to yield direct commercial benefit to corporations. "

In August 2012, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a final rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 13(p)-1, requiring SEC-reporting companies that manufacture or contract to manufacture products that contain “conflict minerals” to conduct due diligence on the origin, source and chain of custody of such minerals and provide specialized disclosure regarding the findings of such diligence.

It is estimated that international trade in counterfeit and pirated products exceeds $500 billion or 3% of world trade. In some countries, counterfeits are believed to encompass up to 30% of the market. More importantly, counterfeit and substandard drugs are believed to be responsible for over 1 million deaths each year, including hundreds of thousands of children. Counterfeits cover the spectrum of medicines, both prescription and OTC, as well as different forms of medical devices and surgical instruments and a range of consumer products. In many cases, counterfeit or fake, products are indistinguishable to patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, so detection by specialists is needed. Counterfeit medicines and consumer health products are readily available today in many countries, especially online, and are typically offered at attractive price points, luring buyers with what appears to be “a good deal.”"

    "body": "In the course of doing business, a company may gather personal information about individuals with whom it engages. With the major advances in digital technology and the importance of using data to drive innovation, stay connected with patients and consumers, and maintain compliance with global regulatory and safety standards, it has become increasingly important for individuals to have a clear understanding of how and when their personal information is being used. They need also to have confidence that their information is being handled appropriately and in a manner consistent with their rights and with applicable legal requirements. We believe companies have a responsibility to protect every individual’s right to privacy, and to establish reasonable measures, including those prescribed by law, to ensure appropriate handling and protection of patient and consumer information in their possession."

    "title": "Disaster Relief",
    "body": "Corporations operate in the heart of communities. Whether multi-national or local, corporations draw their employees, suppliers, resources and social license to operate from neighboring communities. When disaster strikes—whether it’s a natural disaster, extreme weather phenomenon, infrastructure or construction failure, or even a terrorist event—everyone’s affected. In these circumstances, the interdependency of community and corporate life obliges people to come together to provide emergency relief, urgent resources and lifesaving assistance. Supporting medical teams address the pressing health issues is one of the most critical first responses in any disaster. For a healthcare company, therefore, moving quickly to provide medicines and other healthcare support is an important role."

    "body": "Employers impact people’s lives in very meaningful ways. This impact extends not only to our direct employees and the employees of our business partners, but also to their families, communities and the broader society in which they live and work. While countries have many laws governing employment and labor rights, an employer’s influence extends well beyond the provisions of laws and regulation, encompassing many different aspects of a person’s life throughout their employment lifecycle. For example, fair and equitable compensation; inclusive, safe and healthy working environments; learning and development programs; and opportunities to progress and make a contribution to local community life are just a few of the areas in which people experience the potentially transformative effects of employment on their lives."

In many cases, regulation defines minimum standards, and EH&amp;S Management systems must therefore support compliance, as well as drive continuous improvement and learning. "

Information assets can include proprietary product formulas, information used in manufacturing processes, customer data or any information systems required for the proper functioning of the company. In today’s advanced technological environment, where more information than ever is stored electronically, information assets are under constant threat from malicious cyberattacks that can disrupt business functions and/or compromise the security of personal data that the organization is committed to protect. A proactive information security strategy to properly manage information assets and protect against such deliberate, as well as inadvertent, threats is necessary to safeguard any business and its stakeholders."

The vast majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) found in aquatic ecosystems are a result of normal patient and consumer use and excretion following the use of medicines that are taken to prevent, cure or alleviate a medical condition. A second pathway is through improper disposal of unused or expired medicines by patients and consumers who flush them down toilets or pour them into drains. The third pathway is through wastewater discharged from API manufacturing sites. A major source of PCPE is from washing off products from the body during cleansing activities."

    "title": "Sales, Marketing and Scientific Engagement",
    "body": "The healthcare industry, like any other, has a right to market its products to drive awareness and promote their availability. However, the primary consideration for the use of a healthcare product or medicine relates to its suitability to treat a medical condition or meet a medical need as both indicated by a regulatory body and determined by healthcare professionals (HCPs). These considerations should be separate, as far as possible, from commercial interests. Therefore, healthcare companies are expected to align themselves with ethical standards relating to marketing, promotion and sales of healthcare products, to protect patients and consumers and to refrain from activities that might inappropriately influence the decisions of HCPs.
